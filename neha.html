        <div class="storiesparas">
            <p class="storiespara"> Two years ago, I was battling severe depression. Medication helped, therapy helped, but something was still missing. Then a friend gifted me a basic painting kit and suggested I try creating something—anything.</p>
            <p class="storiespara"> I had no formal training, no artistic background. But I started with simple patterns, inspired by the Indian folk art I grew up seeing around me. The act of focusing on creating something, of watching colors blend and forms emerge, became my daily meditation.</p>
            <p class="storiespara"> What started as therapy evolved into a passion. I discovered mandala art, learned about the meditative practice of creating intricate geometric patterns. Each circle I drew, each petal I colored, was a step away from anxiety and toward peace.</p>
            <p class="storiespara"> I joined local art groups, took workshops on traditional Indian art forms, connected with artisans who generously shared their knowledge. I found a community of healers and creators who understood that art is not just about the final product—it is about the journey of creation itself.</p>
            <p class="storiespara"> Now, I conduct art therapy workshops for people dealing with mental health challenges. We use various Indian art forms—Mandala, Zentangle inspired by Madhubani, simple pottery—anything that allows people to express without words.</p>
             <p class="storiespara"> Art saved my life. Not in a dramatic, overnight way, but slowly, gently, one brushstroke at a time. It gave me purpose, community, and a way to transform pain into beauty.</p>
              <p class="storiespara"> If you are struggling, pick up a brush, some clay, some colored pencils. You do not need to be good at it. You just need to start.</p>
